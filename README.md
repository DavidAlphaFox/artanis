GNU Artanis
=========

GNU Artanis aims to be a web application framework for Scheme.
The philosophy of Artanis is to be very radical, and to try
cutting-edge things.
So use it at your own risk...however, playing with it may result in
some cool experiences!

## Features:

* GPLv3+ & LGPLv3+
* Very lightweight - easy to hack and learn for newbies.
* Support JSON/CSV/XML/SXML.
* A complete web-server implementation, including an error page handler.
* Aims to be a highly concurrent and performant server in the future.
* Has a Sinatra-like style route, hence the name "Artanis" ;-)
* Supported databases (through guile-dbi): MySQL/SQLite/PostgreSQL.
* Nice and easy web cache control.
* Efficient HTML template parsing.

* Contributing to the Artanis framework -

  Thank you very much for contributing! However, Artanis is still in Beta, which means the architecture design is prone to major changes.

  So at the moment we accept only tiny or obvious fixes - please **do not** make big changes, they won't be accepted!

## Thanks for testing!
