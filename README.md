GNU Artanis
=========

GNU Artanis aims to be a web application framework for Scheme.
The philosophy of Artanis would be very radical to try cutting-edge things.
So you are under your own risk to use it. However, it may bring cool experiences
when you play it. 

## Features:

* GPLv3+ & LGPLv3+
* Very lightweight: easy to hack and learn for newbies.
* Support Json/CSV/XML/SXML.
* A complete web-server implementation, include error page handler.
* Aim to be high concurrency performance of the server in the future.
* sinatra-like style route, that's why it names "artanis" ;-)
* Database support(with guile-dbi): mysql/sqlite/postgresql.
* Easy and nice web cache control.
* Efficient HTML template parsing.
