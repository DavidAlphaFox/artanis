GNU Artanis aims to be a web application framework for Scheme.
The philosophy of Artanis would be very radical to try cutting-edge things.
So you are under your own risk to use it. However, it may bring cool experiences
when you play it. 

## Features:

* GPLv3+ & LGPLv3+
* Very lightweight: easy to hack and learn for newbies.
* Support Json/CSV/XML/SXML.
* A complete web-server implementation, include error page handler.
* Aim to be high concurrency performance of the server in the future.
* sinatra-like style route, that's why it names "artanis" ;-)
* Database support(with guile-dbi): mysql/sqlite/postgresql.
* Easy and nice web cache control.
* Efficient HTML template parsing.

  Thank you very much to contribute code! However, Artanis is still in Beta, which means the archetecture design is unstable (unstable as in variable).
  
  So we accepts tiny or obvious fixes at present, please try NOT to make big change, it won't be applied!
